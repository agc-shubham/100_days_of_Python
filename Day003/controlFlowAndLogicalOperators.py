# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5
# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.
# e.g.
# 6 รท 2 = 3 with no remainder.
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))

# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people. 
# We're going to use the super scientific method recommended by BuzzFeed.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# This video gives you more details on this:
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."

# e.g.
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times R occurs 1 time U occurs 2 times E occurs 2 times
# Total = 5
# L occurs 1 time O occurs 0 times V occurs 0 times E occurs 2 times
# Total = 3
# Love Score = 53
# Print: "Your score is 53."
